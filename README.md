## Introduction

This automation monitors your followed artists, discovers new events, and sends actionable reminders with calendar attachments. It eliminates manual checks across multiple apps and websites, ensuring you never miss presales, on-sales, or tour announcements. It benefits teams and power users with scalable device automation, robust scheduling, and human-like interaction patterns.

### Automating Artist Event Discovery & Reminders
- Tracks artists (from Spotify or seed lists) and fetches events, presales, and venue updates automatically.
- Deduplicates and enriches events with city/venue/ticket links, then schedules reminders at smart intervals.
- Delivers alerts via email, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or pushâ€”with ICS calendar attachments.
- Supports geo-filters, time windows, and priority thresholds to reduce noise and focus on relevant shows.

## Core Features

- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Run on real Android phones or emulators (Bluestacks/Nox). Handles UI flows, deep links, and background tasks reliably on heterogeneous hardware.
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Control devices wirelessly using secure pairing and Accessibility bridges; ideal for device farms where cable management is impractical.
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Randomized delays, scroll jitter, variable tap pressure/coordinates, and viewport timing to reduce detection and align with human UX patterns.
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Rotate multiple Spotify and messaging accounts with isolated profiles, cookies, and per-account rate limits.
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Horizontal scale across 50â€“1000 devices with per-device queues, health checks, and watchdogs.
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Grow reach via multi-channel reminders and collaborative lists; more touchpoints lead to higher attendance conversion.
- **Premium Support:** Priority debugging, device-farm onboarding, and custom connector development (venues, ticketing, CRM).
- **Geo-Aware Event Filtering:** Only notify for events within user-defined radius/cities; auto-adjusts while traveling (optional IP-based geofence).
- **Smart Reminder Cadence:** Pre-sale alert, on-sale day ping, and 24-hour before-show nudgeâ€”configurable per user or per artist.
- **Calendar Sync & ICS Exports:** Generates `.ics` attachments and syncs to Google Calendar/Outlook; embeds venue, time, and ticket links.

**Additional Capabilities**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Event Source Aggregation** | Pulls events from multiple sources (official links, venue pages, ticket sites, public APIs/RSS) with dedupe/merge logic. |
| **Notification Orchestrator** | Routes messages to Email, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Slack; retries with exponential backoff and fallbacks. |
| **Stealth & Fingerprinting** | Per-device fingerprints, proxy rotation, DNS-over-HTTPS; randomized UI paths to minimize behavioral patterns. |
| **Audit Logs & Replay** | Structured logs (JSONL) with screenshots and HAR-like UI traces for debugging, QA, and compliance. |
| **Policy-Aware Rate Limiter** | Global + per-account quotas; token buckets and jitter to remain within API and platform boundaries. |
| **Secrets & Config Vault** | Encrypted credentials (`.env`/KMS) and per-environment overrides; hot-reload on config change. |

## How It Works (must)

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The automation is triggered from the Appilot dashboard where you select regions, artists (from Spotify follows or CSV), channels (Email/Telegram/WhatsApp), and reminder cadence.
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot controls Android devices/emulators through UI Automator/Appium to fetch artist/playlist context and open deep links; server workers aggregate events from configured sources and normalize them.
3. **Output or Action** â€” The system dispatches notifications (with tickets/venue links and ICS) and optionally creates calendar entries; it can also update your CRM or a shared Google Sheet.
4. **Other functionalities** â€” Robust retry logic, circuit breakers, per-device health checks, detailed logs, screenshots, and parallel processing ensure reliable execution at scale.

## Tech Stack (must)

- **Language:** Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework, Cucumber  
- **Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, MonkeyRunner, Accessibility  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues (RQ/Celery/Worker pools), Real device farm

## Use Cases (must)

- **Touring fans** use it to track favorite artists and get pre-sale/on-sale alerts, so they can secure tickets on time.  
- **Event promoters** use it to push geo-targeted show reminders to segmented audiences, so they can increase attendance.  
- **Music curators/brands** use it to sync artist events into shared calendars, so teams can plan content around tours.  
- **Agencies** use it to manage thousands of reminders across devices, so they can scale campaigns without burnout.

## FAQs

**How do I configure this automation for multiple accounts?**  
Add each account profile in `config/settings.yaml` with its proxy and fingerprint profile. The scheduler assigns tasks round-robin and enforces per-account rate limits.

**Does it support proxy rotation or anti-detection?**  
Yes. You can enable rotating residential/mobile proxies in `utils/proxies.py`. Humanizer and randomized UI paths reduce deterministic patterns.

**Can I schedule it to run periodically?**  
Yes. Use cron-style schedules in the Appilot dashboard or the Python scheduler. Tasks can run hourly/daily with jitter to avoid synchronized bursts.

**How are events deduplicated across sources?**  
The normalizer hashes (artist, venue, city, date) and merges metadata; conflicts prefer official venue/ticketing links unless overridden.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks (must)

- **Execution Speed:** Processes 100â€“200 artist checks per minute per backend worker; device UI actions ~30â€“60 interactions/minute with humanized delays.  
- **Success Rate:** 95% end-to-end reminder delivery under normal network conditions.  
- **Scalability:** Designed for 300â€“1000 Android devices with sharded queues, per-device watchdogs, and auto-healing.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Lightweight workers (<200MB RSS typical) and headless emulators where supported; adaptive backoff under load.  
- **Error Handling:** Retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers per source, structured logging, screenshots, and alerting to Slack/Email.
